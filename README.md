# Flood-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Developed a machine learning model to predict flood occurrences using the monthly rainfall index of Kerala (1900â€“2018). Implemented KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Ensemble Learning to analyze rainfall patterns and classify flood events. Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data preprocessing, model training, and visualization, improving prediction accuracy by evaluating multiple algorithms.
